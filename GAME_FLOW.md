# Ludo Game - User Flow Documentation

## ðŸŽ® Complete Game Flow

### 1. Landing Page (Lobby)

Users arrive at `/game` and see two options:

#### Create Room

- Select number of players (2-4)
- Click "Create Room"
- Generates unique 6-character room code
- Automatically joins as host
- Proceeds to Waiting Room

#### Join Room

- Enter room code shared by friend
- Click "Join Room"
- Joins existing game
- Proceeds to Waiting Room

### 2. Waiting Room

The waiting room displays:

- **Room Code**: Large, copyable code to share with friends
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator of players joined
- **Player Slots**: Grid showing filled and empty player slots
  - Host is marked with ðŸ‘‘ crown icon
  - Players marked with ðŸŽ® controller icon
  - Empty slots show waiting state
- **Live Updates**: Real-time updates as players join/leave

#### Auto-Start Logic

- Game automatically starts when all required players join
- No manual "Start Game" button needed
- Smooth transition from Waiting â†’ Playing state

### 3. Game Play

Once all players join:

- Game board renders with professional styling
- Players assigned colors (yellow, blue, red, green)
- Turn-based gameplay with clear indicators:
  - Green highlight on current player's turn
  - Dice roll button enabled only on player's turn
  - Real-time game state updates

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

### Chess.com Inspired

- **Minimal & Clean**: No clutter, focus on gameplay
- **Professional Color Scheme**:
  - Indigo/Purple gradients for primary actions
  - White cards with subtle shadows
  - Clear visual hierarchy
- **Smooth Transitions**: All state changes animated
- **Responsive Icons**: Emoji icons for quick recognition

### KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- **Three Clear States**: Lobby â†’ Waiting â†’ Playing
- **One Action Per Screen**: Create/Join â†’ Wait â†’ Play
- **Self-Explanatory UI**: No instructions needed
- **Instant Feedback**: Copy confirmation, turn indicators
