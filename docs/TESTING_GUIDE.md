## Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Basic Flow Test
- [x] Both players connect
- [x] Both players join room
- [x] Game starts with 2 players
- [x] Players can roll dice
- [x] Players can move tokens
- [x] Turns alternate correctly

### ‚úÖ Game Rules Test
- [x] Can only roll on your turn
- [x] Rolling a 5 allows leaving base
- [x] Legal moves are calculated correctly
- [x] Captures work (not on safe cells)
- [x] Bonus move granted on capture
- [x] Win detection works

### ‚úÖ Error Handling Test
- [x] Can't roll on opponent's turn
- [x] Can't move invalid tokens
- [x] Can't join full room (4 players max)
- [x] Can't start with less than 2 players
- [x] Disconnect handling works

---

## Console Testing (Alternative Method)

If you prefer using browser console instead of the test page:

### Open Console (F12)
```javascript
// Player 1 in first browser window
const socket1 = io('http://localhost:3001');

socket1.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected:', socket1.id);
  socket1.emit('game:join', { roomId: 'test', playerId: 'player_1' });
});

socket1.on('game:joined', (data) => {
  console.log('Joined:', data);
});

socket1.on('update:state', (data) => {
  console.log('State:', data.gameState);
});

socket1.on('roll:result', (data) => {
  console.log('Rolled:', data.dice, 'Moves:', data.legalMoves);
});

// Start game
socket1.emit('game:start', {});

// Roll dice
socket1.emit('roll:dice', {});

// Move token (example)
socket1.emit('move:token', { tokenId: 0, newPosition: 5 });
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution**: Make sure Socket.IO server is running
```bash
node socket-server.js
```

### ‚ùå "404 Not Found" for test page
**Solution**: Make sure Next.js is running
```bash
npm run dev
```

### ‚ùå "Not your turn"
**Solution**: Wait for the other player to finish their turn. Check the logs to see whose turn it is.

### ‚ùå No legal moves
**Solution**: This is normal! If you can't move, turn automatically passes to next player.

### ‚ùå Page doesn't load Socket.IO
**Solution**: Check browser console for CDN errors. Try refreshing the page.

## Advanced Testing

### Test with 3-4 Players
1. Open 3-4 browser tabs
2. Connect all as player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4
3. Test turn rotation with more players

### Test Reconnection
1. Disconnect Player 1 mid-game
2. Reconnect Player 1
3. Verify game state is preserved

### Test Different Rooms
1. Use different room IDs in inputs
2. Verify players in different rooms don't interact

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is complete:
1. Integrate WebSocket client into your actual game UI
2. Replace test buttons with game board interactions
3. Add animations for token movements
4. Add sound effects for dice rolls and captures
5. Implement player avatars and profiles

4. Check the logs in both player panels
5. Try refreshing the page and reconnecting

Happy testing! üéÆ
